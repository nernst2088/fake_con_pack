This is a py code to simulate a fake concrete pack, which can calculate the porosity, density, and tortuosity of the fake pack.
It can be used for lab education or concrete mix learning. Pls notice the 3d plot is just for demo, don't relate it to the real world.
You can modify this py code further for your research, such as generage particles according to Fuller's curve or any other models, or based on any particle distribution test results in a csv or txt type files.
If this code does help your researh for publication, pls cite this link in your work.
The container in the code is 0.001m^3. The weight unit is kg. The water is asked for its volume.
